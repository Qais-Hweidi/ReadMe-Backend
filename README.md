# ReadMe-Backend

With the rise of artificial intelligence, it is becoming increasingly important to keep learning every day, so there is a need for better e-book platforms that offer enhanced features and user experience. The ReadMe project aims to develop an advanced digital reading solution combining modern technology and an easy-to-use interface.
The key aspects of this project include creating a seamless reading ecosystem that adapts to users' needs. The platform will support various book formats and offer features such as customizable interfaces, flexible subscription plans, and secure payment options.
Our main objective is to develop a modern platform where users can easily find, download, and read digital books. The solution will support multiple book formats and allow users to access their downloaded content without an internet connection. We will implement AI technology to enhance the overall user experience.
For development, we will use Flutter for the application interface and Node.js for backend services. This technical approach ensures the platform will be efficient, scalable, and capable of handling features from user authentication to AI-powered features.
While other e-book platforms exist, ReadMe sets itself apart through its AI integration and focus on user experience. By addressing common limitations in existing platforms, such as offline access and format support, ReadMe aims to provide an improved solution for digital reading.
